# Extended Signal Detection Theory with Decision Value Correlation

This python module implements some basic methods for analyzing
psychophysical data. In particular, it implements decision value
correlation as described in the paper

Sebastian & Geisler (2018): Decision-Variable Correlation. J Vis, 18(4):
3.

## Install

You can use
```
pip install esdt
```
to install the package.

The package is a [pybuilder](http://pybuilder.github.io/) project. Check
out their documentation for how to build and install it.

## Basic usage

There are two modules `esdt.sdt` for signal detection theory (and decision
variable correlation) and `esdt.pmf` for psychometric function estimation.
